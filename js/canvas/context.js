// Shared runtime context for the canvas sub-modules (router, viewport,
// crossing-bumps, migration, interactions, ...). canvas.js is the single
// WRITER — it creates the JointJS graph/paper in init() and wires this object —
// and the sub-modules are READERS. One-way data flow keeps the dependency graph
// acyclic: canvas.js -> sub-module, never the reverse (mirrors the persistence
// `pctx` pattern from Phase 3).
//
// `graph` is the global JointJS namespace, available without import; everything
// instance-specific lives here.

  //   deliberately written TOGETHER in canvas.setLoadingJSON(). The private flag
  //   feeds the in-canvas guards; this cctx copy feeds the extracted sub-modules
  //   that can't see canvas.js's closure. persistence (json-pipeline/storage),
  //   tabs, and mermaid-import DRIVE it by calling setLoadingJSON() around
  //   graph.fromJSON(). Keep the dual-write — do NOT build an event bus for one
  //   boolean.
