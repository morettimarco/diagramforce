# Diagramforce

Free browser-based visual diagramming tool for Salesforce architects and consultants. Create architecture diagrams, data models, Data Cloud field mappings, process flows, org charts, Gantt charts, and UML sequence diagrams — all in your browser, with no account, no backend, and no data leaving your machine.

## Features

### Diagram types

- **Architecture Diagrams** — Map system landscape, integrations, and Salesforce clouds with 1700+ SLDS icons
- **Data Model Diagrams** — Define objects, fields, and relationships with ER notation (crow's foot, one, zero-or-one, etc.); tag objects with optional SLDS header icons (contact / account / email / third-party such as Snowflake)
- **Data Mapping Diagrams (Salesforce Data Cloud / Data 360)** — Map the end-to-end data journey from source systems → Data Lake / Data Model Objects → Activations, with field-level source→target mappings, mapping types (Standard, Formula, Streaming/Batch Transform, Calculated Insight), a synced table view, and CSV field import/export. One click turns an existing Data Model into a Data Mapping diagram
- **Process Diagrams** — Design business processes with BPMN and flowchart shapes
- **Organisation Charts** — Document team hierarchy with person cards, departments, and teams, plus a RACI toolkit (Task and Task Group shapes for responsibility matrices)
- **Gantt Charts** — Plan project timelines with tasks, milestones, phases, and dependencies
- **Sequence Diagrams** — UML sequence diagrams with participants, actors, activation boxes, and alt/loop fragments; reply-style messages default to dashed

### Editing & layout

- **Smart Node Layout** — Content auto-centers based on what's set: text-only, icon + text, or description layout
- **Auto-Sizing parents** — Containers, Zones, BPMN Pools and other parent shapes auto-grow *and* auto-shrink to keep one grid dot of padding below the lowest embedded child. Toggle off in Display menu if you want manual control
- **Smart shape conversions** — Convert between Node / Container / Icon and the new shape stays embedded in its previous parent whenever the embedding rules allow it
- **Multi-select** — Cmd/Ctrl+click *or* Shift+click; Shift+drag on blank canvas for rubber-band selection
- **Resize Guides** — Tracking lines extend from resized edges for easy alignment
- **Alignment & spacing guides** — While dragging, live guides snap edges and centres to nearby shapes, straighten directly-connected links, and show edge-to-edge spacing in px for even distribution
- **Crossing bumps** — Where two links cross without connecting, EDA-style "jump-over" arcs make the non-connection explicit (toggle in the Display menu)
- **Auto Layout** — One-click force-directed layout (Display menu) untangles connected components; Data Mapping lays out by data layer, and sequence diagrams get automatic lane + port alignment
- **Field-level lineage** — In a Data Mapping diagram, hover or select a single field to trace its full source→destination path; everything off the lineage dims back
- **Animate Connectors** — Optional Display toggle (every diagram type) that runs a directional flow along every connector; while it's on, the PNG export becomes an animated GIF
- **Multi-tab** — Work on multiple diagrams simultaneously with independent undo/redo per tab
- **Single-step undo for drags** — A continuous drag is one undo command, not one per pixel; structural edits (embeds, conversions, deletes, bulk field imports) each collapse into one undo step too
- **Guided onboarding** — A first-visit welcome splash and a diagram-type-aware walkthrough, relaunchable anytime from the Help button
- **Contextual empty-canvas hints** — A ghost wireframe suggests what to drop first for each diagram type
- **Dark / Light Theme** — Full theme support with Salesforce-aligned brand colours

### Persistence & sharing

- **No Backend** — Everything runs client-side; your diagrams never leave your browser
- **Offline-capable** — Service worker caches the app shell + every runtime library; after first load, refresh in airplane mode and the app boots from cache
- **Export & backup** — Save to browser (90-day local storage); export as JSON / PNG / WEBP / animated GIF; the Export Manager bundles selected or all diagrams (plus your templates) into a single file; share via a copyable URL
- **Custom Templates** — Capture any multi-selection as a reusable template stored locally, then drop it into any diagram from the stencil
- **Mermaid Import (beta)** — Paste mermaid.js source (`graph` / `flowchart` / `stateDiagram` → Process, `erDiagram` → Data Model, `sequenceDiagram` → Sequence) and convert into a native diagramforce diagram with auto-layout
- **Fit to Content** — Automatically fits viewport when loading shared or saved diagrams

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Diagramming | [JointJS v4.0.4](https://www.jointjs.com/) (vendored, same-origin) |
| UI design system | [Salesforce Lightning Design System v2.29.1](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) — sprites self-hosted |
| Compression | pako (vendored) for share-URL deflate |
| Animated export | gifenc (vendored) for GIF export |
| Code | Vanilla JavaScript with ES modules — no framework, no bundler, no build step |
| Styling | CSS custom properties with theme switching |

## LLM diagram generation

[`DIAGRAM_JSON_SPEC.md`](DIAGRAM_JSON_SPEC.md) documents the complete JSON structure for all diagram types — including a dedicated guide for generating Salesforce Data Cloud (Data 360) mappings with valid field types, categories, and DLO/DMO layers. Feed it to any LLM (e.g. Claude) and ask it to generate a diagram JSON for a specific architecture, data model, Data Cloud field mapping, process flow, etc. The output can be imported directly via *Load → Paste JSON* (or *Load → Import JSON* for a file).

## Browser support

Tested in Chrome, Vivaldi, and Safari. Service worker requires a Service-Worker-capable browser (all modern desktop browsers).
